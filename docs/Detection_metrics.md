### 📉 Class-wise Observations

- **Glioma**
  - Performance is slightly lower, particularly in recall and mAP@0.5:0.95.
  - Potential causes:
    - Greater variation in appearance
    - Lower quality or quantity of labeled examples
    - Harder-to-learn features

- **Meningioma & Pituitary**
  - High precision and recall
  - Robust detection and generalization

### ✅ Final Verdict

> **The YOLOv8 model shows excellent performance overall, especially for meningioma and pituitary tumor detection. Glioma detection is good but may benefit from targeted improvements.**

| Category             | Verdict          |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Overall Accuracy     | 🔥 Excellent     |
| Generalization       | ✅ Strong        |
| Glioma Detection     | ⚠️ Needs tuning  |
| Deployment Readiness | ✅ Production-ready for testing |

### 🛠️ Next Steps

- **Improve Glioma Performance**
  - Apply augmentation techniques specific to glioma features
  - Balance dataset if class imbalance exists
  - Manually review mislabeled or borderline cases

- **Tune Confidence Threshold**
  - Lower the threshold (e.g., `conf=0.3`) to improve recall during inference

- **Visual Inspection**
  - Use saved prediction images to analyze false positives/negatives

- **Generalization Testing**
  - Evaluate on external or completely unseen data
